# React 3 day workshop

Clone the project and cd into directory and run yarn install or npm install    

To start the application run yarn dev and open another terminal window    
and run yarn api. The last command will produce a rating using the ratingsAPI,    
a node package.    

Using Jest and Enzyme are a joy to use, I really like how these work.
